    "> In my study, I first observed that most films with the highest revenues also first appeared to have higher popularity scores and higher budets than the average. I was most curious to see whether there was a strong correlation between the amount of revenue that a film earned and the overall popularity of the film as rated by the TMDB popularity score. With a correlation of only .61555575 my findings showed that there was surprisingly not a strong correlation between these two variables. \n",

    "> I also wanted to see if the popularity of films has increased over time. By grouping the data by the release date year, I was able to see a number of statistical figures. The one that stuck out to me the most was the steady increase in the number of films per year. From 1961 to 2015 the count of films in my revised dataset increased from 10 to 160. I suspect the increasing number of films may be correlated with a higher demand for these films from potential moviegoers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Although the data was useful in drawing a few good insights, there are certainly more areas that could be explored, such as the correlation between certain film genres and the revenue of the film, or the popularity of films made by certain directors. I also beleive that I was limited by the measure of popularity that was used in the dataset. The TMDB popularity score may or may not be the best way to measure the popularity of a film. Perhaps I would have seen a stronger correlation between the variables I investigated and the popularity if a different measure was used. "
